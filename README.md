## Motivation

Driver drowsiness is a leading cause of accidents, with over 1 in 5 fatal crashes involving drowsy driving. This project aims to leverage machine learning to build a robust model capable of generalizing to new instances. We explore Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) techniques to develop a model that detects drowsiness in drivers, thereby aiming to reducing accidents caused by driver fatigue and improving public safety.
